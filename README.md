Yeah, yet another todo list that stores your todos in local storage. I've written one in React before but wanted to use no frameworks to see the difference (basically to do some imperative DOM manipulation). The design isn't great but added a couple of animations.

To run it: clone it and then run [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) at the root directory.You can then browse to http://localhost:8080/index.
