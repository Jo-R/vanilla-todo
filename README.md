Yeah, yet another todo list that stores your todos in local storage. I've written one in React before but wanted to use no frameworks to see the difference (basically a glutton for punishment via DOM manipulation). I also wanted a small project I could fiddle around with a bit in terms of things like css animations and do some trial and error design since I'm hopeless at that.

It's wip so see todo.txt for what I still have left to do.

To run it: clone it and then run [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) at the root directory.You can then browse to http://localhost:8080/index.
